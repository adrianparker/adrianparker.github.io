Personal website for Adrian Parker.

No, not the British Olympic pentathlete, nor the VP of tequila marketing from Texas (seriously, how do you get that job!), and definitely not the parapsychology professor from Sweden who specialises in altered states of conciousness. 

I'm one of the other ones. And this is my website.

I've done personal websites before. Generally they're pretty terrible.
This time around I thought I'd have a play with something a bit more... conversational. Sort of. A cross between a digital Twistaplot adventure and a chat bot? Maybe that's just an excuse to do as little CSS as possible.
The code is all in Javascript, cos I got lazy a while ago now, and thus that's the only language I use anymore. I'm into ideas like not using any libraries and going serverless as much as possible, probably mutually exclusive ideals, so I guess we'll see how that goes.

Comments and feedback welcome. And bug reports are cool too. Best way is to leave them in the site (when I get to coding that bit). 

Until we meet again.
