## Summary
This project is the personal blog of Adrian Parker, [AdrianParker.com](https://www.adrianparker.com/).

Contains writing on topics like product management, finance, software, investment, and travel; adorned with whimsical anecdotes about life and random other things that interest me.

## Tech

Website is static content, generated using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Highly recommended looking into both of those if you are wanting a website of your own.

## How To

### Install

Git clone into a directory, change into that directory, then:
```
npm install
npm run-script build
```

### Serve site locally

Open Terminal at root of folder, then run this command.
```
npm run-script serve
```
You should see output showing you the site is now being served, most likely at localhost:8080. Ctrl-C to terminate the server. It will live reload on file changes.
