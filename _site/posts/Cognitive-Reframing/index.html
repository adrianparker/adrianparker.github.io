        Choosing how you think can change your result

        <h2>Can you look after my kid?</h2>
<p>
    We pulled up outside the flat. Mum had made parking the car look harder than usual, I could tell she was preoccupied with something. Maybe anxious even. Perhaps I was eight? In hindsight that seems about right. I remember feeling small and lost and confused. Something wasn't right with Mum, I wasn't in school, we were outside this strange place, struggling to park our tank of a car in what must have been a perfectly normally sized space, and all I really remember is feeling a long way out of place.
</p>
<p>
    I don't think I knew then that Mum was visiting the hospital.<br>Later, I knew, but not then. You didn't give context to kids back then.
</p>
<p>
    We went inside the flat. It was small, as I remember, but welcoming, shafts of sunlight through the net curtains, piles of things everywhere, loved things, things of value. TV in the corner, maybe it was on during the day, it never would have been at our place. Fruit bowl on the table. A plate of home made biscuits. A pot of tea. It felt warm, friendly, homely; but it didn't feel like our home.
</p>
<p>
    A lady greeted us. She lived there. Mum knew her, but I didn't. She was shorter than Mum, and older, she talked a lot, in a kindly way, buzzing around like a bird hovering around a nest. There was a husband, she explained. And two boys. Murphy, and Harry. They were older than me, and not there, but I was a boy and they were boys and so I was deposited in the bedroom they shared. It felt foreign. Clothes on the floor. A general sense of chaos. Sports posters on the walls, sports equipment on the floor, but nothing Star Wars, only a few books, no Lego. It was a boy's bedroom, sure, but distinctly unfamiliar.<br>I found a comic book, I remember feeling grateful, like finding a life raft after being abandoned at sea. Mum and the lady closed the door to go talk in the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
    After a while, an eternity but only an hour or two, having read every comic book I could find, I ventured down the hall. The lady was in the kitchen, buzzing around, but Mum was gone.<br>I don't remember quite what she said, exactly, Mum would be back, or words to that effect, and not to worry, no doubt. She meant to be comforting I'm sure, yet I felt very small, and alone.<br><br>
    That was my earliest memory of Elsa.
</p>
<h2>Funerals and old friends</h2>
<p>
    For a time, a year or two, I returned to Elsa's care fairly regularly. Mum had to go to the hospital a lot. The doctors didn't know what it was, but then they did, and multiple sclerosis entered the family lexicon. It took them a while though, and while they worked it out, I spent a lot of time eating Elsa's biscuits and re-reading those comics. I met Murphy once or twice. He was a nice guy, a bit older than me, fit, sporty, handsome. Opposite to me in every respect. I don't know what he made of this younger geeky boy that showed up in his room. But I do know he, just like his Mum, accepted me and treated me kindly.
</p>
<p>
    Eventually though, multiple sclerosis changed the script. Mum went from visiting the hospital, to being visited at the hospital, where she now permanently stayed. The journey took a few years, but it isn't much more than a blur to think back on. And while she moved in one direction, my father and I moved in the other. Circumstances forced independence, I looked after myself, we both learned how to keep a home.<br>I didn't need to stay at Elsa's any more.
</p>
<p>
    Elsa wasn't the type to be discouraged though. Just like that hovering bird, she kept an eye on the fledglings that left the nest. She would call, on the old bakelite phone screwed to the kitchen wall, at random times out of the blue, and would chat, at length, with whoever answered. She'd update you on her family, most of whom you didn't know, and the local goings on. She'd ask after us all, even the folks she hadn't met, and she'd pepper the conversation with blessings and proclamations of love.<br>We'd roll our eyes when we realised it was Elsa on the other end of the line, settling in for the duration, but you'd enjoy it all the same. It felt normal. It stayed the same.<br>Sometimes she'd bring biscuits to the door.
